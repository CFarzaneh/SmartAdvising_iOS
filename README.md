# SmartAdvising_iOS
iOS App for SmartAdvising

This is the iOS application for SmartAdivising. This app features logging into your university, selecting major from that university and year (undergraduate/graduate). This will then bring you to the corresponding lobby (queue) of that major. Once logged in, you can view how many people are in queue and add yourself to queue. This app features doing POST and GET requests along with PATCH. In order to run these asynchronously, alamofire is used. To wait until request is complete, we use a nice feature in Swift called completion handlers.
